<abstract>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) exploit signals from node features and the input graph topology to improve node classification task performance. Recently proposed GNNs work across a variety of homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Among these, models relying on polynomial graph filters have shown promise. We observe that polynomial filter models, in several practical instances, need to learn a reasonably high degree polynomials without facing any over-smoothing effects. We find that existing methods, due to their designs, either have limited efficacy or can be enhanced further. We present a spectral method to learn a bank of filters using a piece-wise polynomial approach, where each filter acts on a different subsets of the eigen spectrum. The approach requires eigendecomposition for a few eigenvalues at extremes (i.e., low and high ends of the spectrum) and offers flexibility to learn sharper and complex shaped frequency responses with low-degree polynomials. We theoretically and empirically show that our proposed model learns a better filter, thereby improving classification accuracy. Our model achieves performance gains of up to ~6% over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.</abstract>

**An extensible Benchmarking Graph-Mesh dataset for studying Steady-State Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations** <br />

<abstract>Recent progress in Geometric Deep Learning (GDL) has shown its potential to provide powerful data-driven models. This gives momentum to explore new methods for learning physical systems governed by Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) from Graph-Mesh data. However, despite the efforts and recent achievements, several research directions remain unexplored and progress is still far from satisfying the physical requirements of real-world phenomena. One of the major impediments is the absence of benchmarking datasets and common physics evaluation protocols. In this paper, we propose a 2-D graph-mesh dataset to study the airflow over airfoils at high Reynolds regime (from $10^6$ and beyond). We also introduce metrics on the stress forces over the airfoil in order to evaluate GDL models on important physical quantities. Moreover, we provide extensive GDL baselines.
