[**Shima Alizadeh**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shima-alizadeh-4853b340/) is an Applied Scientist at AWS AI Labs at Amazon Web Services working on diverse machine learning problems including SciML/AI4Science, Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO), higher order optimization methods, personalization, and recommendations. Prior to joining AWS AI Labs she worked at Adobe as Machine Learning Engineer/Researcher for time-series forecasting problems with applications for intelligent marketing. She received her PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Stanford University with focus on high performance computing (HPC) for computational engineering, where she designed and implemented robust multi-scale models to study physical problems that involve transport phenomena and fluid dynamics. Shima’s passion lies at the interface of HPC for computational physics and Artificial Intelligence to solve problems that are governed by Physics based PDEs and ODEs with various applications such as climate research, transport phenomena, and engineering design optimization. At AWS AI Labs, by leveraging her expertise in HPC, numerical methods, machine learning, and optimization, she has been working on different problems such as Physics-Guided Neural Operators, Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) for SciML models, and ML models that respect physics constraints.

[**Neil Ashton**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neilashton/)
is a Principal Computational Engineering Specialist at Amazon Web Services (AWS), as well as being a fellow of the Institute of Mechanical Engineering (IMechE). He leads the Amazon-wide Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) working group and acts as a CFD subject matter expert across the diverse departments using CFD at Amazon. Prior to joining AWS he obtained a Masters and Ph.D. at the University of Manchester focusing on turbulence modeling, and previous positions were at the University of Oxford, NASA Ames Research Center, and Lotus Formula 1 Team, as well as consultancy roles for a range of automotive and aerospace companies . His expertise is on applying and developing the next generation of CFD approaches with a particular focus on interplay between high-fidelity turbulence models, machine learning and high-performance computing. He created the Automotive CFD Prediction Workshop (whose 4th edition is happening in September 2024), and leads the hybrid RANS-LES technical working group for the 5th AIAA High-Lift Prediction CFD Workshop. In the past year his particular focus has been spearheading the development of industrialized versions of ML methods (e.g MeshGraphNet) that can be used to accelerate the engineering design process.

<div class='bioWrapper'>
[**Nina Miolane**](https://www.ece.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/nina-miolane) is an Assistant Professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) in Computational Biomedicine. She holds an M.S. in Mathematics from Ecole Polytechnique (France) & Imperial College (UK), and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from INRIA (France) in collaboration with Stanford University. After her studies, Nina spent two years at Stanford University in Statistics as a postdoctoral fellow, and worked as a deep learning software engineer in the Silicon Valley. At UCSB, Nina directs the [BioShape Lab](https://bioshape.ece.ucsb.edu/), whose goal is to explore the “geometries of life” and turn biological shapes into biomedical insights. The BioShape Lab also co-develops [Geomstats](https://github.com/geomstats/geomstats), an open-source software for geometric statistics and (deep) learning.

<div class='bioWrapper'>
[**Bastian Rieck**](https://bastian.rieck.me) is the principal
investigator of the AIDOS Lab at the Institute of AI for Health at the
Helmholtz Centre Munich, Germany. Bastian received his M.Sc. degree in
mathematics, as well as his Ph.D. in computer science, from Heidelberg
University in Germany. Previously, he was a postdoctoral researcher and,
later on, senior assistant at the Machine Learning and Computational
Biology Lab at ETH Zurich. His main research interests are algorithms for
graph classification and time series analysis, with a focus on
biomedical applications and healthcare topics. Bastian is also enticed
by finding new ways to explain neural networks using concepts from
algebraic and differential topology. He is a big proponent of scientific
outreach and enjoys blogging about his research, academia, supervision,
and software development. Bastian recently organized a tutorial on
topological machine learning for ECML, the European Conference on
Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in
Databases, a workshop on Topological Data Analysis & Beyond at NeurIPS
2020, and a workshop on Geometrical and Topological Representation
Learning at ICLR 2021.
